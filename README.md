ScreenshotMonitor is a time tracking / screenshot monitoring tool used to get a clear picture of time and money spent on each project, client and task. Employees start monitoring using a lightweight desktop application. The tracked time, screenshots, activity level, active applications & URLs, selected projects and task notes â€“ are all uploaded online for both manager and employee to see.

We are using our own backend server for the handling the API requests.

Our documentation includes a quickstart guide to help you get started with ScreenShot Monitoring Service, as well as guides on how to add and manage teams, projects, clients, user data into the application.
